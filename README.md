Multiphysics App using MOOSE
=====

This is a fork to create a new MOOSE-based application to reproduce the [MOOSE Workshop Tutorial](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/workshop/?_ga=2.254312584.1245162299.1607356805-326391532.1575633882).

Problem Statement based on:
Pamuk and Ozdemir, "[_Friction factor, permeability, and inertial coefficient of oscillating flow through porous media of packed balls_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0894177711002640)", Experimental Thermal and Fluid Science, v. 38, pp. 134-139, 2012.
